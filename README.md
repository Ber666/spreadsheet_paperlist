# spreadsheet_paperlist
Traditional paper management softwares like Zotero/Mendeley usually don't support flexible customization. Google spreadsheet makes it possible to create a paper list in the style you like. This script calls API from semantic scholar and complete the meta-information of the paper itself.


## How to use
1. Copy the script to `Apps Script` from the spreadsheet menu
2. Create a "On edit" trigger to `get_paper_data`
3. Now you can input any paper titles in the first column and other information will pop up automatically! (Date, Venue, Affiliations, URL, TLDR)
